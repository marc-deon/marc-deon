Salutations (kaj saluton、初めまして, etc), my very definitely real name is Marc d'Eon. I go by some others, too.

I've been programming for about 8 years. Python is my general go-to, Godot is my go-to for games (or anything needing UI really), and I started with C# in Unity.

I’m currently learning Unreal Engine 5 and C++ development and looking for jobs in which to apply those. I'd like to study Rust and other aspiring C killers in the future.

Aside from programming and gaming, I'm interested in music and linguistics. I speak some Japanese and Esperanto, and dabbled in others over the years but forgot anything usable in those.
